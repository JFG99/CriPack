This is a rewrite of CriPakTools.  I lost the specific fork from which it came, but the original fork chain can be found below.  
It is an extensively rewritten and updated code base.  Much of the original code was inaccurate, missing details, and did not take into account headers during updates.  



CriPakTools-mod

This tool is based off of code by Falo , Nanashi3 ,esperknight and uyjulian

I forked and added batch reimport and compress code .

Tool to extract/update contents of CRIWARE's CPK archive format. (aka CRI FileMajik)  
This is based off of code uploaded by Falo's code released on the Xentax forums (http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10646) which was futher modified by Nanashi3 (http://forums.fuwanovel.org/index.php?/topic/1785-request-for-psp-hackers/page-4), which is then further modified by esperknight (https://github.com/esperknight/CriPakTools).
